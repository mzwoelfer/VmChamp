# VmChamp Documentation

Simple and fast creation of throwaway VMs on your local machine. Connect via SSH seconds.

VmChamp allows users to quickly create virtual machines using a command-line interface.
It supports various Linux distributions and utilizes `KVM` (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) for virtualization.

## How It Works

- **VM Creation:** Users initiate VMs and can customize the settings (OS, Memory, CPUs, etc.).
- **Storage:** All VMs are stored at `~/VmChamp`, which is created upon first using the tool.
